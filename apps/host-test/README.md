# host-test

This is a test application that validates gRPC service behavior and includes database connectivity testing. Here's a breakdown:

## Test Structure

### gRPC Service Tests
Uses the `tape` testing framework to verify `barClientService` behavior:

1. **Positive Test Case**
   - Tests successful execution with "bar" input
   - Expects output.data to equal "ok"
   - Uses strict equality comparison

2. **Negative Test Case**
   - Tests error handling with "foo" input
   - Expects the promise to reject
   - Uses try/catch to verify rejection behavior

### Database Integration
Includes basic database connectivity testing:

- Sets logger prefix to "host-test"
- Tests todo functionality via `todoRequestService`
- Logs todo count to console

## Technical Components

- Integrates with `remote-grpc` module for service testing
- Uses `remote-db` module for database operations
- Implements async/await pattern for promise handling
- Uses structured test assertions

This appears to be part of a testing suite, combining both service-level tests and database connectivity verification, likely used for integration testing or development verification.
