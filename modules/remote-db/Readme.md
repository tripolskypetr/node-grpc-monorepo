## TodoViewService

The `TodoViewService` is a TypeScript class that provides methods for managing tasks in a Todo application. It has dependencies on `todoDbService` and `loggerService`. 

The class has several methods: `create`, `update`, `read`, `list`, and `remove`. 
- The `create` method takes an object of type `ITodoDto` and returns a Promise that resolves with the created task.
- The `update` method takes the task ID and an object of type `Partial<ITodoDto>` to update specific properties of the task. It returns a Promise that resolves with the updated task.
- The `read` method takes the task ID and returns a Promise that resolves with the specific task.
- The `list` method returns a Promise that resolves with an array of all tasks.
- The `remove` method takes the task ID and returns a Promise that resolves with the removed task.

These methods interact with a database service (`todoDbService`) and log events using the `loggerService`.

## TodoRequestService

The TodoRequestService is a TypeScript class that provides methods for managing tasks. It has a constructor that initializes the loggerService property. The getTodoCount method is a function that returns the current count of todos as a Promise. It also implements the IClearableTtl and IControlMemoize interfaces, which allow for caching and controlling the memoization of this method.

The loggerService property is an instance of a logging service, which can be used to log messages related to the TodoRequestService.

Overall, this class provides a way to retrieve the current count of todos and utilizes caching, memoization, and logging to improve performance and maintain a record of the tasks.

## TodoDbService

The `TodoDbService` is a TypeScript class that provides methods for interacting with a Todo database. It has a constructor that initializes the `appwriteService` property, which is used to communicate with the Appwrite service.

The class offers several asynchronous methods:
1. `findAll()` - Retrieves all Todo documents from the database and returns them as an array of `ITodoRow` objects.
2. `findById(id: string)` - Retrieves a specific Todo document from the database based on its ID and returns it as an `ITodoDocument` object.
3. `create(dto: ITodoDto)` - Creates a new Todo document in the database using the provided `ITodoDto` object and returns the created document as an `ITodoDocument` object.
4. `update(id: string, dto: Partial<ITodoDto>)` - Updates an existing Todo document in the database with the provided partial `ITodoDto` object and returns the updated document as an `ITodoDocument` object.
5. `remove(id: string)` - Deletes a Todo document from the database based on its ID and returns an empty object.

These methods utilize the `appwriteService` property to communicate with the Appwrite service and perform CRUD operations on the Todo database.

## LoggerService

The `LoggerService` is a TypeScript class that provides logging functionality. It has a constructor which initializes the `_logger` property, likely an instance of a logging library or object. The `log` property is a function that allows you to log messages with optional arguments. The `setPrefix` property is a function that allows you to set a prefix for the log messages.

In summary, `LoggerService` is a class that provides logging capabilities through its `log` and `setPrefix` functions, using an underlying logging instance stored in the `_logger` property.

## AppwriteService

The `AppwriteService` is a TypeScript class that provides methods for interacting with Appwrite's API. It has a constructor that initializes the client, storage, and databases properties. The class also provides several methods for working with Appwrite's storage, such as uploading files and retrieving file URLs or download links.

The `client`, `storage`, and `databases` properties are instances of the Appwrite Client, Storage, and Databases classes respectively. The `createId` method generates a unique ID, while the `upsertDocument` method allows you to upsert a document in the specified collection.

The `setDatabases` and `setStorage` methods allow you to set new instances of the Databases and Storage classes respectively. The `init` method is used to initialize the Appwrite service.

The `uploadFile`, `uploadBlob`, and `removeFile` methods allow you to upload files or blobs, and remove a file from storage. The `getFileURL`, `getDownloadURL`, and `getFileSize` methods retrieve the URL, download link, and size of a file stored in Appwrite's storage respectively.
