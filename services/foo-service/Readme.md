## FooService

The FooService is a TypeScript class that provides an API for executing a request and returning data. The constructor is used to initialize the class, but it does not take any parameters. 

The class has a property called "Execute" which is a function that takes in a request object as its parameter. This function will process the request and return a string data as its result.
